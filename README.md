Authentication
This API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication.

Obtain JWT Token: After successful login, a JWT token is returned. The token must be included in the Authorization header for any protected endpoints.

Example:

text
Copy
Authorization: Bearer your_access_token_here
Token Expiration: JWT tokens are valid for a certain period (e.g., 1 hour). After expiration, the user must log in again to obtain a new token.
